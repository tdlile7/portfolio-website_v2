        I am a highly motivated and self-driven individual who is seeking their
        first opportunity to enter the software development space. The
        continuous innovation of software technologies, in addition to the easy
        of accessibility and effect of software applications is what makes the
        prospect of being apart of this field so incredibly exciting. Most of my
        knowledge and experience revolves around utilizing the MERN stack for
        web application development. My preference would be to work as a
        full-stack developer, to not only utilize the full-scale of my knowledge
        but also to contribute and be apart of both sides of application
        development. With that said, I am looking to join teams that can offer
        mentorship where I could receive feedback that would ultimately help
        improve and refine my own coding practices and skills. If you wish to
        get a hold of me, please email me
        <a href="mailto:tlile1429@gmail.com"> @tlile1429@gmail.com</a> or via
        the
        <a href="#contactMe"> contact form</a> below. I look forward to hearing
        from you soon!
